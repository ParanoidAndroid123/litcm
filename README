Language Identification and Transliteration (LI&T): 

This tool is used for language identification and transliteration of Indic-words 
in code-mixed data. This tool is meant for six Indian languages; Hindi, Bengali, 
Kanadda, Tamil, Malayalam and Gujrati code mixed with English. The input file 
should contain text in only two languages, English and any of the above mentioned 
Indian languages. It is necessary to mention the Indian language used in the code-
mixed data by passing an argument after the input file as shown below. 

Preprocessing:

1.  The query file available is a binary file that computes Conditional Posterior 
    Probabilities (CPP) of lang1 and lang2. Copy this file to usr/bin as shown 
    below:
	    ======================
	    sudo cp query /usr/bin
	    ======================

    Go to /usr/bin directory and set mode to executable as shown below:
	
	    ====================
	    sudo chmod 111 query
	    ====================

2.  Move to convertor-indic-1.4.9 directory and copy its path using pwd command to 
    the .bashrc file as shown below:

	    ============================
	    export convertorIndic="path"    
	    ============================

	    e.g.
	    
	    ===============================================================
	    export convertorIndic="/home/irshad/LIT/convertor-indic-1.4.9"    
	    ===============================================================
